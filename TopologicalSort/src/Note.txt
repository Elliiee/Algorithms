A directed graph (or digraph) is a set of vertices and a collection
of directed edges. Each directed edge connects an ordered pair of
vertices.

Outdegree: the number of edges pointing from it
Indegree: the number of edges going to it




Topological Sort
Given a digraph, put the vertices in order
such that all its directed edges point from a vertex earlier in the order to a vertex later in the order.
Or report doing so is not possible.
